**SUMMARY:**

Module 5 of the C++ course covers Input/Output Streams. The module explains that streams are the sequence of bytes given as input to the executing program and the sequence of bytes that comes as output from the executing program. The input and output operation between the executing program and devices like keyboard and monitor are known as "console I/O operation," while the input and output operation between the executing program and files are known as "disk I/O operation."

The module discusses the three main classes used to deal with files in C++: `fstream`, `ifstream`, and `ofstream`. These classes are available in the `fstream` header file.

*   `ifstream` is a stream class to read from files. It provides input operations and contains an `open()` function with a default input mode. It inherits functions like `get()`, `getline()`, `read()`, `seekg()`, and `tellg()` from the `istream`.
*   `ofstream` is a stream class to write to files. It provides output operations and contains an `open()` function with a default output mode. It inherits functions like `put()`, `write()`, `seekp()`, and `tellp()` from the `ostream`.
*   `fstream` is a stream class to both read and write from/to files. It provides support for simultaneous input and output operations and inherits all the functions from `istream` and `ostream` classes through `iostream`.

The module also discusses the modes used to open files, including `in` (input), `out` (output), `binary` (binary mode), `ate` (start at the end of the file), `app` (append to the existing contents), and `trunc` (truncate the existing contents).

**QUIZ:**

Q1: What is the purpose of the `ifstream` class in C++?
A1: The `ifstream` class is used to read from files.

Q2: What is the default open mode for the `ifstream` class?
A2: The default open mode for the `ifstream` class is `ios::in`.

Q3: What is the purpose of the `ofstream` class in C++?
A3: The `ofstream` class is used to write to files.

Q4: What is the default open mode for the `ofstream` class?
A4: The default open mode for the `ofstream` class is `ios::out`.

Q5: What is the purpose of the `fstream` class in C++?
A5: The `fstream` class is used to both read and write from/to files.

Q6: What is the default open mode for the `fstream` class?
A6: The default open mode for the `fstream` class is `ios::in | ios::out`.

Q7: What is the difference between `ios::in` and `ios::out` modes?
A7: `ios::in` mode is used for reading from a file, while `ios::out` mode is used for writing to a file.

Q8: What is the purpose of the `binary` mode in C++?
A8: The `binary` mode is used to perform operations in binary mode rather than text mode.

Q9: What is the purpose of the `ate` mode in C++?
A9: The `ate` mode is used to start the output position at the end of the file.

Q10: What is the purpose of the `trunc` mode in C++?
A10: The `trunc` mode is used to discard any contents that existed in the file before it is open.
